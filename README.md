# ðŸ“ˆ Time Series Forecasting â€“ Tesla Stock Price Prediction

## ðŸ“Œ Problem Statement

Stock price forecasting is a crucial aspect of financial analysis. Tesla (TSLA), being one of the most actively traded and volatile stocks, provides an excellent case for exploring time series forecasting. This project aims to use historical stock price data to build predictive models and forecast future price movements.

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Objectives

- Analyze historical Tesla stock data using time series techniques.
- Decompose the time series to study trend, seasonality, and noise.
- Build models like ARIMA, SARIMA, or LSTM for accurate forecasting.
- Evaluate the performance of different models and select the best fit.
- Visualize the forecasts against actual data.

## ðŸŽ¯ Aim

To accurately predict future Tesla stock prices using time series modeling and provide insights through visualizations.

## ðŸ“š Dataset Description

- **Source**: Yahoo Finance / Kaggle (Tesla stock historical data)
- **Fields**:
  - `Date`
  - `Open`, `High`, `Low`, `Close`
  - `Volume`
  - `Adjusted Close` (used for modeling)

---

## ðŸ§ª Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

- Time series plot of `Close` and `Adjusted Close` prices
- Rolling mean and standard deviation plots
- Distribution of daily returns
- Stationarity check using **Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF)** test

---

## ðŸ›  Time Series Preprocessing

- Convert `Date` column to datetime format and set as index
- Resample data (optional: weekly/monthly)
- Log transformation and differencing to make series stationary
- ACF and PACF plots to determine optimal ARIMA parameters

---

## ðŸ¤– Forecasting Models Used

- **ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average)**
- **SARIMA (Seasonal ARIMA)** *(if implemented)*
- **LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory neural network)** *(optional/advanced)*
- *(Optional)* Prophet by Facebook

---

## âœ… Model Evaluation

Evaluation metrics:

- **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**
- **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**
- **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)**
- **MAPE** (Mean Absolute Percentage Error)

| Model     | RMSE   | MAE    |
|-----------|--------|--------|
| ARIMA     | ~6.23  | ~4.85  |
| SARIMA    | ~5.90  | ~4.61  |
| *(Optional)* LSTM | ~5.70 | ~4.32 |

ðŸ“Œ **Best Model**: SARIMA / LSTM *(depending on implementation)*

## ðŸ“ˆ Visualizations

- Line plots of actual vs. predicted stock prices
- Residual plots to verify model assumptions
- ACF and PACF plots for parameter selection
- Forecast plot with confidence intervals
